# Day 4: Automation with Bash & Makefiles

## Why this matters
Manual commands are prone to error. Automation ensures that anyone (or any machine) can run the project with zero knowledge of the internal details.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Bash Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: Instructs the OS to use the Bash interpreter.
- **Idempotency**: The `setup.sh` checks `if [ -d ".venv" ]` before creating it, ensuring the script is safe to run multiple times.
- **Makefile vs Script**: 
    - Bash is for logic ("If file exists...").
    - Make is for task execution ("Run training").
- **.PHONY**: A directive in Makefiles to avoid file name conflicts.

## Commands Created
- `make install`: Installs dependencies.
- `make run`: Executes the model script.
- `make clean`: Resets the workspace.
